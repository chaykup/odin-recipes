<h3>This baked chicken marinara could not be easier. Seasoned, pan-seared 
    chicken breasts bake in the same skillet with marinara and mozzarella 
    for a cozy, comforting dinner.</h3>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>4 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
    <li>8 ounces low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 2 cups)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup torn fresh basil leaves</li>
    <li>cooked pasta, for serving (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) with racks in upper and lower third positions.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle both sides of chicken evenly with salt and Italian seasoning. Heat oil in a deep, large oven-safe skillet over 
        medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>Pour marinara sauce evenly over chicken and sprinkle with mozzarella. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Bake on the lower third rack in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, the sauce is bubbling around the edges, and 
        a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove skillet from oven and remove foil. Increase oven temperature to broil. Once preheated, return skillet to upper 
        third rack and broil until cheese is lightly browned in spots, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Garnish with fresh basil and serve with pasta</li>
</ol>
